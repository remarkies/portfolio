      <p class="opacity-75 mb-2">The Alpi app simplifies the process of contacting a mountain professional. The decision for a mountain professional is supported with meaningful profiles.</p>
      <p class="opacity-75 mb-2">This is achieved by displaying a profile picture and qualifications of the mountain professionals, the activities offered and their ratings, as well as the display of testimonials from other users.</p>
      <p class="opacity-75 mb-2">Secondarily, the app is also a platform for mountain professionals themselves, where they can market themselves by maintaining their profile with their own offered activities.</p>
      <p class="opacity-75 mb-8">Communication among each other is supported by an integrated messaging service, which facilitates initial contact. Among other things, the view of upcoming activities helps to keep an overview.</p>
